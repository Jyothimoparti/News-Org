Angular Application to filter news related to UIC on the web

## Description

This angular application consumes a Restapi endpoint provided by newsapi.org to display all the news articles related to UIC on the websites that are mentioned previously. Each news article when clicked, displays the details of the article such as author, description, published date, sources, URL and title.

Two way binding function is showcased by "Changing an article title at the bottom of the page that has attributes of the article when clicked on a particular article, changes the title name in the list of the articles above"
To view the endpoint and documentation on the query parameters, refer https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything

**Note: It displays articles that are mentioned upto last 1 month till today and also gives only little description on the article. In order to view the article completely, refer the URL mentioned in the article attributes on the home page. The above limitations are due to Developer subscription. You can pay and upgrade the subscription at https://newsapi.org/pricing to avoid the limitations.
